# Design Specification

## 1. Overview

`aki-xcat` is a command-line tool for concatenating files. It mimics the behavior of the standard `cat` utility but with added capabilities for handling compressed files. The tool is designed to be simple and efficient, following the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well.

## 2. Core Components

The application is structured into several key modules, each with a distinct responsibility.

### 2.1. `main.rs` - The Entry Point

- **Purpose**: Serves as the application's entry point.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Parses command-line arguments from the environment.
    - Initializes the `RunnelIoe` for standard I/O operations.
    - Calls the `execute` function from the `libaki_xcat` library.
    - Handles top-level errors and sets the process exit code.

### 2.2. `lib.rs` - The Library Crate

- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the core logic of the application, making it reusable.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Defines the public `execute` function, which orchestrates the main workflow.
    - Integrates the `conf`, `run`, and `util` modules.
    - Provides a clear and documented API for external consumers.

### 2.3. `conf` Module - Configuration Management

- **Purpose**: Manages command-line argument parsing and configuration.
- **Components**:
    - `mod.rs`: Defines the `CmdOptConf` struct and its methods.
    - `parse.rs`: Implements the command-line option parsing using the `flood-tide` crate.
    - `cmd.help.rs.txt`: Contains the help message text.
    - `cmd.match.rs.txt`: Contains the logic for matching command-line arguments.
- **Key Data Structures**:
    - `CmdOptConf`: A struct that holds the parsed command-line options and arguments.

### 2.4. `run.rs` - The Executor

- **Purpose**: Implements the main file processing logic.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Iterates through the input files or standard input.
    - Calls the `adapt_input` utility to handle different file formats.
    - Formats the output according to the specified options (e.g., line numbers, file names).
    - Writes the final output to the standard output stream.

### 2.5. `util` Module - Utility Functions

- **Purpose**: Provides a collection of helper functions and modules.
- **Components**:
    - `mod.rs`: Declares the sub-modules.
    - `adapt_input.rs`: Detects file types and provides a unified reader interface.
    - `err.rs`: Defines custom error handling utilities, such as `BrokenPipeError`.
    - `opt_uc_x_param.rs`: Handles special `-X` options.

## 3. Key Algorithms and Data Structures

### 3.1. File Type Detection

The `adapt_input` function in `util/adapt_input.rs` is responsible for detecting the file type. It does this by reading the first few bytes of the file and comparing them against the magic numbers of supported compression formats (gzip, xz, zstd, lz4).

- **Magic Numbers**:
    - `gzip`: `1f 8b`
    - `xz`: `fd 37 7a 58`
    - `zstd`: `28 b5 2f fd`
    - `lz4`: `04 22 4d 18`

If no magic number is matched, the file is treated as plain text.

### 3.2. Input Processing Pipeline

The core logic follows a pipeline pattern:

1.  **Input Source**: `adapt_input` takes a list of file paths. If the list is empty or contains "-", it reads from standard input.
2.  **File Opening**: Each file is opened.
3.  **Decompression**: Based on the file type detection, a suitable decompressor is chosen (e.g., `GzDecoder`, `XzDecoder`).
4.  **Reading**: The file is read line by line using a `BufReader`.
5.  **Formatting**: The `run` function formats each line according to the command-line options (`-n`, `-f`, `--path-name`).
6.  **Output**: The formatted lines are written to standard output.

### 3.3. Command-Line Argument Parsing

The `flood-tide` crate is used for parsing command-line arguments. This provides a simple and efficient way to define and handle options in a GNU-style format. The configuration is defined in `conf/parse.rs`, with the help text and matching logic in separate text files for clarity.

## 4. Error Handling

- The `anyhow` crate is used for flexible and easy error handling.
- The `runnel` crate is used to manage I/O streams, which helps in handling `BrokenPipe` errors gracefully. The `is_broken_pipe` function in `util/err.rs` allows the application to exit silently when the output pipe is closed, which is standard behavior for command-line tools.

## 5. Dependencies

- **`anyhow`**: For error handling.
- **`flood-tide`**: For command-line argument parsing.
- **`runnel`**: For I/O stream management.
- **`flate2`**, **`xz2`**, **`zstd`**, **`lz4`**: For handling compressed files (enabled via feature flags).

## 6. Future Improvements

- **Binary Mode**: Implement a `-b` or `--bin` option to handle binary files without any text processing.
- **Performance**: For binary mode, reading and writing in larger chunks instead of line by line could improve performance.
- **More Compression Formats**: Add support for other compression formats like bzip2.
