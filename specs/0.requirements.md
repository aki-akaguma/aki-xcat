# Requirements Specification

## Overview

`aki-xcat` is a command-line tool that concatenates multiple files and outputs them to standard output. It provides functionality similar to the `cat` command, but in addition to plain text files, it can also automatically decompress and concatenate files compressed with gzip, xz, zstd, and lz4.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. File Concatenation

- Takes one or more files as arguments, concatenates them in order, and outputs the result to standard output.
- If no file is specified, or if the argument is `-`, it reads from standard input.

### 2. Supported Formats

The tool automatically recognizes the following file formats, decompresses them appropriately, and reads the content.

- Plain text
- gzip (`.gz`)
- xz (`.xz`)
- zstd (`.zst`)
- lz4 (`.lz4`)

### 3. Default mode

This program will operate in text mode unless the `-b` option is specified. The behavior when text mode is:

  - Concatenates the content in text mode as UTF-8.
  - In case of a UTF-8 character sequence error, it outputs a replacement character (U+FFFD) and continues processing.

### 4. Options

The following command-line options are provided.

- `-b`, `--bin`:
  - Concatenates the content in binary mode without any conversion.
  - The `-n`, `-f`, and `--path-name` options are disabled.

- `-n`, `--number`:
  - Adds a line number to the beginning of each output line.
  - Line numbers are sequential across all files.
  - The format is a right-aligned 6-digit number followed by a tab, and then the original line content.

- `-f`, `--file-name`:
  - Adds the file name to the beginning of each output line.
  - The file name is enclosed in `"`.
  - If specified along with the `-n` option, the line number is displayed after the file name.

- `--path-name`:
  - Adds the path name to the beginning of each output line.
  - The path name is enclosed in `"`.
  - If specified along with the `-n` option, the line number is displayed after the path name.

- `-H`, `--help`:
  - Displays a help message and exits.

- `-V`, `--version`:
  - Displays version information and exits.

### 5. Output

- Outputs the concatenated content of the files to standard output.
- If options are specified, the output is formatted accordingly.

## Non-functional Requirements

- The minimum supported Rust version is 1.60.0.
- The `anyhow` library is used for error handling.
- The `runnel` library is used to manage standard input/output and standard error.
- The `flood-tide` library is used to parse command-line arguments.
